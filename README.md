Code, configuration and prompt templates for our **R**einforcement **L**earning Enhanced **A**daptive **P**lanning Framework (RLAP)
We temporarily place the code and data of different subtasks in different directories. In each directory:
- Environment of RLAP: Environment.py
- Training process of Actor model: DQN.py
- LLM deployment (directly deployment without fine-tuning): LLM_server.py

In fact, the above code files in different subtask directories are very similar (because the universality of RLAP), and we will integrate them into a unified script in the future.
